[!] for MVP

[x] Updater script (core, plugins, themes) [!]
-- Error/crash handling (log errors; re-running if it failed should still output accurate info)
-- Write all script output to a logfile
-- Wrapper script to run everything
-- Quick rollback script (restore live?)

-- Utilizing SFTP mode is not great. Maybe this would work better like this:
--- Check out the repo in a basic linux container that has Git + WP-CLI + Terminus
--- Use Git to update everything

-- Basic VRT
