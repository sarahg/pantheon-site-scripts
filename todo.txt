[x] Update script (core, plugins, themes)
-- Error/crash handling (log errors; re-running if it failed should still output accurate info)
-- Writes list of updates performed to html file
-- Wrapper script to run everything + generate report
-- Quick rollback script (restore live)

or maybe the report is totally separate and uses the git log?
